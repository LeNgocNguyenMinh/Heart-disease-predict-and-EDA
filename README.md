# Heart-disease-predict-and-EDA
In this project, I try to find out which is the best algorithms for a popular disease: heart attack.\
Some word before we begin , you all already know how dangerous heart attack is. So, until now, a lot of people still try their best to increase the acccury of predict result to help the doctor know is this patient get this diease or not. So i want to give them too, even it just a litte help, i still hope no one will get this diease. \
The firt part of code is import libraries and EDA (like always huh).\
Then, next part is clean data.\
Finally, i tried 4 algorithms: KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision tree.\
I don't want to spoil about the results so hope you guy read and feel free to comment. Thanks.
